# Repository for the project of Neural Networks in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics course
## Title : **Deep Q Learning**

The source code provided in this Repository is a first example of a scholastic implementation
of a recent progress in probabilistic IA : the usage of *Convolutional Neural Networks*, so a
Deep Learning Tool, in the contest of reinforcement learning ( in particular Q Learning).

This project is being developed by:

- Marco Capotondi

- Giulio Turrisi
