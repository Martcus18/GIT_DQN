# Repository for the project of Neural Networks in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics course
## Title : **Deep Q Learning**

The source code provided in this Repository is a first example of a scholastic implementation
of a recent progress in probabilistic IA : the usage of *Convolutional Neural Networks*, so a
Deep Learning Tool, in the contest of reinforcement learning ( in particular Q Learning ).
In order to avoid an hard computation and to improve efficence, was used an AlexNet architecture, trained using ImageNet, in was used as base for the code the http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/tf_alexnet/, developed by the Computer Science Department of the Toronto's University, and extracted the Full Connected layer, reducing largely the training step of the Net.

This project is being developed by:

- Marco Capotondi

- Giulio Turrisi
